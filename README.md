# WowAutoReview Addon

This repository will become a World of Warcraft addon that collects and persists character and guild data to disk.

Primary goals
- Collect structured data about characters and guilds (names, realms, classes, levels, membership, timestamps, etc.).
- Persist that data between sessions so it can be reviewed or exported later.
